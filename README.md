**Project Title:**  
TBD

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a database for an industry, company, or idea of your choosing. Over multiple sprints, you will progressively refine your database concept, gather requirements, build an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, convert it into a relational schema, and ultimately create and query the physical database.

Each sprint includes tasks that must be documented in the **Project Report Template**. By the end of the project, your team should have a fully functional database along with thorough documentation of each stage of the process.

### Goals and Objectives
- **Demonstrate Requirements Analysis:** Collect, prioritize, and document both high-level and detailed requirements for your chosen domain.  
- **Design a Robust Data Model:** Move through conceptual, logical, and physical database design (ER diagrams, relational schema, normalization).  
- **Implement a Working Database:** Use SQL to create tables, implement queries, and set up indexing and views.  
- **Document Thoroughly:** Continuously update the Project Report Template for each sprint.

## 2. Timeline and Deliverables

The project is divided into four main parts (a project proposal plus three sprints). You will fill out each corresponding section in the **Project Report Template** as you progress.

### 2.1. Proposal (Project Idea, Goals, Scope, and Objectives)
- **Task:**  
  - Propose a project idea (industry, company, or concept).  
  - Define the project’s main goal and scope.  
  - Identify key objectives and deliverables.  
- **Expected Output:**  
  - Fill the “Content, Scope, and Objectives” subsection in the Project Report Template.  
  - Include all group member names in the uploaded document.  
- **Deadline:**  
  - March 26, 2025

### 2.2. Sprint 0
- **High-Level Requirements & Analysis:**  
  - Identify the main data entities and their relationships.  
  - Document the initial requirements gathered from your research or client/user perspective.  
- **High-Level Conceptual Design:**  
  - Produce a rough ER diagram capturing the key entities, attributes, and relationships.  
- **Expected Output:**  
  - Fill the “Sprint 0” section in the Project Report Template.  
  - Summarize your high-level requirements and conceptual ER diagram.  
- **Deadline:**  
  - March 29, 2025
### 2.3. Sprint 1
- **Identify and Prioritize Requirements:**  
  - Refine your highest-priority requirements based on any feedback or new insights.  
- **Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Database Design:**  
  1. **Conceptual Model:** Update your ER diagram with detailed attributes and relationships.  
  2. **Logical Model:** Map your ER model to a relational schema.  
  3. **Physical Schema:** Translate the schema into a database-specific format (e.g., SQL DDL statements).  
- **Expected Output:**  
  - Fill the “Sprint 1” section in the Project Report Template.  
  - Provide an updated ER diagram, relational schema, and any relevant SQL creation scripts.  
- **Deadline:**  
  - April 5, 2025

### 2.4. Sprint 2
- **Refine and Concretize Requirements:**  
  - Finalize the functionality and data requirements your database must satisfy.  
- **Database Design Validation:**  
  - Verify that your tables and relationships follow the rules of normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF as required).  
- **Physical Implementation:**  
  - Create the actual tables in your chosen DBMS.  
  - Write and test at least three key SQL queries (e.g., SELECT queries that showcase joins, aggregations, or subqueries).  
- **Expected Output:**  
  - Fill the “Sprint 2” section in the Project Report Template.  
  - Provide updated design diagrams, final table schemas, normalization proof, and SQL queries.  
- **Deadline:**  
  - April 12, 2025

### 2.5. Sprint 3
- **Indexing and Views:**  
  - Justify and create indexes for your most commonly queried data.  
  - Create views to simplify access to your data for end users or specific queries.  
- **Expected Output:**  
  - Fill the “Sprint 3” section in the Project Report Template.  
  - Document how your indexing strategy improves performance, and show the creation and usage of views.  
- **Deadline:**  
  - April 19, 2025

## 3. Project Report Template

Throughout the project, you are required to document your work using the provided **Project Report Template**. Your final submission will include:

1. **Title Page** (Project title, group members, date)  
2. **Proposal** (Content, Scope, Objectives)  
3. **Sprint 0** (High-level requirements, conceptual design)  
4. **Sprint 1** (Detailed conceptual design, logical, and physical schema)  
5. **Sprint 2** (Refined design, normalization, table creation, key queries)  
6. **Sprint 3** (Indexing, views)  
7. **References** (if any used)

Each group should designate one member to upload the latest version of the template before the deadlines. Make sure group member names are always included in each submission.

## 5. Getting Started

1. **Form Your Group**  
   - Ensure you have no more than five members.  
2. **Brainstorm Project Ideas**  
   - Pick a real-world domain you find interesting or you already have data for.  
3. **Set Up Collaboration**  
   - Decide on tools to communicate (e.g., Slack, Teams, email) and store files (e.g., Git, Google Drive).  
4. **Assign Roles**  
   - It may help to designate a lead for each sprint to ensure deadlines are met.  
5. **Follow the Template Strictly**  
   - Each sprint requires thorough documentation.

## 6. How to Submit

- **Proposal Submission:**  
  - One member uploads the “Proposal” section of the Project Report Template by the deadline.  
- **Subsequent Sprint Submissions:**  
  - Update and upload the same document with completed sections for each sprint by their deadlines.  
- **Final Submission:**  
  - Ensure your final Project Report Template includes all sections, ER diagrams, schemas, queries, indexing details, and any other requirements mentioned above.
